During the last month of my Lambda School journey, I had the opportunity to work with a team on a real-life project and showcase the skills I developed throughout the program. This project was for Human Rights First (HRF), a non-profit organization that advocates for human rights and fair implementation of the law in the United States.

Amongst all the excellent work HRF does, I assisted their campaign that helps asylum-seekers throughout the country. Their vision was to create a website that lawyers representing asylum seekers could use to get insight into previous rulings made by a specific judge and utilize this information to build a better case. To do this, I was placed into a cross-functional, remote team of 10 data scientists and 18 web developers and immediately started brainstorming and planning.  

## So... what's the point?
The unique part about the experience is that a different team worked on the project every month, and by the time I got to the project, the previous groups already completed a lot of features. This put me in an exciting position where I could focus on a specific problem instead of doing many things at once. Out of the many features we had to work on, a small group was tasked with visualizations, which seemed straightforward. There are lots of them to choose from, and they are easy to implement; however, selecting a visualization is easier said than done. The importance of this feature is high as all the other work done on the app is to get the data for these graphs, so being mindful of my teammates’ work is vital. One group is working on the data scrapping, which gives the chart life. Another group is working on the web page design and user experience, arguably the most critical part. My contribution is explicitly the last cultivation of all their work, stringing together all the relevant features of the app to form a significant portion of the product. It’ll be the place that most users go to for insight, and those insights will help them do a lot of good for asylum seekers. 


## So... what are you gonna do about it?
With the task and its importance identified, it was tough to narrow down the focus of the visualization. One way that I overcame this challenge is by putting myself in the user’s shoes. Our users will primarily be lawyers, who, to me, are notoriously busy and have little technical knowledge. Given that, I decided to keep the visualization simple and drive impact not as a flashy graph but as a very customizable one. Even though the information delivered is straightforward, it’s relevant enough to use in their specific case. With this idea in mind, my challenge went from deciding on a graph to building a chart that could accomplish the vision I just described. As with most of the problems data scientists encounter, communication and research are the critical components in problem-solving. I spent a lot of time familiarizing myself with Plotly, a plotting library that I have never used before. Between all the reading, practicing, and getting feedback from teammates, I began the actual work on generating the graphs and formatting them in a way they can be displayed on the webpage.


## So... how did you do it?
One essential skill every good Data Scientist needs to master is planning. Careful planning before execution is, to me, the most crucial part of delivering a product effectively. I can’t say I’m anywhere near mastering this skill, but I did see its massive benefit during this project. Because of excellent planning, how to solve the problems we recognize was very clear.

### FastAPI endpoints:
The first major task I was assigned was to set up new endpoints in our API for the visualizations. After a quick crash course by an instructor on FastAPI, I set up a basic endpoint called vis/judge that would receive data about a specific judge, create the visualization, and return the graph in JSON format. Originally I had no idea how to produce a chart in a way the front-end team could display, so I collaborated with a friend on the Web team and came up with the JSON solution.

### Plotly bar chart:
Using the Plotly library for the first time was a bit intimidating. There are many different ways to do the exact same thing, so figuring out which functions and methods to use took a reasonable amount of time. Eventually, I decided to use the Graph Objects (GO) library. The graphs created with GO are automatically serialized to JSON for rendering by Plotly.js, which meant that both the Data Science team and the Front End team could customize and change the graph. Because of this flexibility, we decided that I focused on providing the bar chart with solid data and left the styling decision to the Front End.  
The best visualization I implemented was a stacked bar chart. Essentially a lawyer could go to the judge’s page and pick what feature of a case they were interested in. The resulting graph would show them the judge’s history and tendency.

>In this example, the x-axis is the different protected grounds argued, and the y-axis is the judge’s ruling on each of them. When the argued protected grounds was Social Group, this judge Remanded 2 cases and Denied 4.  


Through pair programming with another Data Scientist, I implemented the code that created the bar chart into that endpoint I had built earlier in the week, and here’s a small part of the result:

The functionality is there where the vis/judge endpoint can take any judge's outcomes and return a graph with the outcome for each different feature. I took the time to make sure all my code was properly documented and bug-free, and the question going forward is: "what features are the most important?" Figuring out which features will have the most impact for the user is a challenge for the next group taking this one, but I know they're gonna ace it!



## So... now what?
So now I'm writing this blog, reflecting on this amazing experience called Labs. This last month has given me so much more confidence in my abilities as a Data Scientist, both technical and non-technical. On the tech side, my knowledge grew significantly. I am familiar now with so many more libraries, and I'm becoming more and more proficient with Python. Equally as important are the new non-technical skills I learned working remotely in such a big team. Giving and receiving feedback, planning and setting deadlines, brainstorming and pair-programming, are just some examples of skills I will be using day one on the job.  

It's a good feeling knowing this bit of work I did will soon help people who are escaping incredibly difficult circumstances, and I have great admiration for the work Human Rights First is doing and will continue to do.
